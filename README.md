Assignments done for a Systems Programming course at the [UFMS Faculty of Computing](https://facom.ufms.br), Brazil.

The course is based on Carnegie Mellon's well-known "Introduction to Computer Systems" and therefore follows Bryant and O'Hallaron's [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/) textbook.


### Description

These assignments are organized one per subdirectory, namely

1. `buildimage`: an ELF32 file reader written in C.
1. `libbi`: an x86-64 assembly implementation for fixed-width big integer arithmetic.
1. `non-preemptive-kernel`: enable multiprogramming in a primitive kernel, with support for kernel threads as well as processes.

Find more details in each project's README files.
