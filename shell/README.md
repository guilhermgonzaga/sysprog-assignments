# A Linux shell

The objective with this project was to understand Linux processes, low-level IO, and signals by implementing a minimal, though realistic, shell.

**Warning:** this project, unlike the others, is not even close to completion, and the existing code is a far cry from proper design and good implementation practices. Currently, there's no real functionality validated or implemented.


### Specification

This project was based on [this one](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall19/cos217/asgts/07shell), from the Department of Computer Science in Princeton University.

This project is not necessarily an acceptable solution to the original specification, as ours was modified to fit time constraints and attendees' diverse curriculum progression.


## Getting started

Development has been aimed at and only simulated on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04 and Mint 19.1 distros).

Everything can be built with the `make` utility.

After a successful build, an executable `shell` is created in `bin/`.
